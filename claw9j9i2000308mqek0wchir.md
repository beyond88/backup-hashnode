# JavaScript Fundamentals

JavaScript! It's an affection of some software developers. I don’t need to introduce this language differently. It is the most widely used language in the software industry. JavaScript is easy to learn. Possible to develop an application without lots of effort. That’s why sometimes we don’t care about its fundamentals deeply. So we have some misconceptions about JavaScript fundamentals. So I am planning to write a series of blogs on its fundamentals and other features. I will write on fundamentals, DOM, client storage, asynchronous JavaScript, error handling, OOP (Object Oriented Programming), and the introduction of ES6 and ES10.


**Fundamentals:**
